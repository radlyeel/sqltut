#   SQL Tutirial with MariaDB
## Reference
https://www.mariadbtutorial.com/
Note that the tutorial uses "mysql" for the command line client.  "mariadb"
also works.  I prefer it.
##  Getting Started with MariaDB
### Some useful "meta" commands
    SHOW DATABASES;
    USE database;
    SHOW [FULL] TABLES [FROM db_name] [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
